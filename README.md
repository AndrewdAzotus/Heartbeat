Heartbeat
=========

A program written in Python, intially for the Raspberry Pi, to update a table on a MySQL database server with a prime number calulator checking and possibly adding to the list of Prime numbers once per minute. Row 0 and 1 contain the greatest prime number found and the date that the program last updated the table.

A simple check in some PHP allows a web page to display a table showing which computers are currently active, which are currently down and how long was/is each machine active for.

It's not neat and tidy code, sorry about that.
